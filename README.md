Zendesk Inc. is a customer service software company headquartered in San Francisco, California, USA, founded in 2007 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Zendesk has 2,000 employees and serves 119,000 paying customers in 150 countries and territories as of 2017. 
Customer and team experience can be enhanced by building powerful products on top of a Zendesk product with APIs, apps, and mobile SDKs.

This Repo holds Python files using API requests to retrieve Customer Call Recordings and store them systematically based on name, client, and date. This well-working version is currently used at my Software Service Company integrated into a task scheduler that runs the script every 24 hours to retrieve the most recent recordings and store them in the correct directories in one of our servers. I created the scripts at the beginning of May 2020.
